# create-discord-bot
create-discord-bot was created to do one thing. Help people, you guessed it, create Discord bots. Thanks to Discord.js, the abstraction of developing a discord bot has been all but removed.


## Features:
- Automatically generate a Discord bot that can be created almost exclusively from your terminal
- Works with modern Discord Bot features such as Slash Commands, and other interactions
- Requires minimal configuration to set the project up. Just follow instructions under Setup and you'll be ready to start creating your server's best bot!

## Filestructure:

Running create-discord-bot will create a filestructure in your desired folder. Here's what the outline of the structure looks like 

```
create-discord-bot/
├─ bot/
├─ replies/
│  ├─ messages/
│  ├─ prompts/
│  ├─ embeds/
├─ interactions/

```
